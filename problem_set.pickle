S"The 'select' is the basic query. We use it to extract information from a\ntable. There are a number of clauses to a select statement. Right now, we'll\nconcern ourself with just two: the column list and the table you are querying.\n\nThe format of the basic select statement is\n\n    SELECT <column list> FROM <table name>;\n\nFor now, we can use the wildcard '*' (without quotes) to select all columns\nfrom a given table.\n\nExamples: http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial -- 1\n\nTask: Write a query that shows all the information about all the salespeople in\nthe database.

It simply counts up all the matched rows and returns a\nsingle record in their place.\n\nExample: http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_nobel_table_can_be_used_to_practice_more_SUM_and_COUNT_functions. -- 1\n\nTask: Write a query that shows the total number of customers in our customer\ntable.\n"
